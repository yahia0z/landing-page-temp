## Description

* The project consists of a landing page of a website built with HTML and CSS and made interactive using JavaScript.
* The landing page consists of:
    1. The page title "Landing Page".
    2. Multiple collapsible sections, each with a heading and text content. Each section has the functionality to be visually differentiated when scrolled into view and to be collapsed or opened when clicked on.
    3. A header with an interactive navigation bar containing all the sections of the page and with the functionality to:
        * Scroll to the desired section when clicked on.
        * Visually differentiate a tab when the corresponding section is scrolled into view.
        * Disappear when the user stops scrolling.
    4. A hamburger menu button that appears on small screens instead of the navigation bar and it:
        * Displays a navigation menu containing the page sections when clicked on.
        * Scrolls to the desired section by clicking on it.
        * Disappears when the user starts scrolling.
        * Has the same other functions as the navigation bar.
    5. A scroll-to-top button that appears when the user scrolls below the fold of the page and scrolls to the top of the page when clicked on.
    6. A footer with the "Udacity" name.
